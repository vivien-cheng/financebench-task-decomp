# FinanceBench Task Decomposition: Executive Summary

## Project Overview
We've developed a framework to evaluate how different language models (GPT-4, Claude, Llama, and Gemini) decompose complex financial questions into structured tasks. The system uses the FinanceBench dataset and implements a DAG-based task decomposition approach.

## Key Findings
- Successfully implemented a robust task decomposition framework
- Evaluated 4 major language models on 8 diverse financial questions
- GPT-4 and Claude showed the best performance (75% success rate)
- Identified areas for improvement in model implementations

## Performance Highlights
- GPT-4: 75% success rate, 3.8 tasks per question
- Claude: 75% success rate, 4.4 tasks per question
- Llama: 75% success rate, 1.5 tasks per question
- Gemini: Implementation needs fixing (0% success rate)

## Next Steps
1. Fix Gemini implementation
2. Improve dependency tracking
3. Enhance task type coverage
4. Address failing questions
