## Key Observations
1. All models struggled with dependency similarity (0.00)
2. GPT-4 and Claude created more tasks per question
3. Llama was more consistent but created fewer tasks
4. Gemini implementation needs fixing
5. Two questions consistently failed across all models

## Error Analysis
1. Common Errors:
   - NoneType errors in task creation
   - Missing dependencies
   - API parameter mismatches (Gemini)

2. Failed Questions:
   - financebench_id_01865: NoneType error
   - financebench_id_01858: NoneType error

## Recommendations
1. Immediate Actions:
   - Fix Gemini implementation
   - Add better error handling for NoneType cases
   - Improve dependency tracking

2. Long-term Improvements:
   - Enhance task type coverage
   - Implement more sophisticated dependency detection
   - Add better error recovery mechanisms
