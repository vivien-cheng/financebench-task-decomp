# Model Comparison Report

## Overview
This report compares the performance of different language models (GPT-4, Claude, Llama, and Gemini) on the task of decomposing financial questions from the FinanceBench dataset.

## Evaluation Metrics
- Task Decomposition Accuracy
- Task Type Identification
- Dependency Resolution
- Output Format Specification
- Overall Performance

## Results

### GPT-4
- **Strengths**: 
  - High accuracy in task decomposition
  - Excellent understanding of financial concepts
  - Consistent output formatting
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Higher API costs
  - Slower response times

### Claude
- **Strengths**:
  - Strong performance on complex financial reasoning
  - Good at handling multi-step tasks
  - Reliable dependency resolution
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Occasionally verbose responses
  - Slightly lower accuracy on numerical tasks

### Llama
- **Strengths**:
  - Open-source model
  - Good performance on basic financial tasks
  - Cost-effective
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Limited context window
  - Lower accuracy on complex tasks

### Gemini
- **Strengths**:
  - Fast response times
  - Good at handling structured data
  - Cost-effective
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Limited financial domain knowledge
  - Inconsistent output formatting

## Recommendations
1. Use GPT-4 for critical financial analysis tasks
2. Use Claude for complex multi-step reasoning
3. Use Llama for basic financial tasks and cost-sensitive applications
4. Use Gemini for quick, structured data processing

## Future Work
